# Introduction-To-Python
The purpose of this repository is to go through the basics and fundamentals of Python with some examples and assignments.
Within this repository, we have two different types of lessons:
* [Python Lessons](lessons/README.md)
* [Optional Non-Python Lessons](optional_lessons/README.md)

Within the Python Lessons curriculum, we go through various topics starting from setting up a Python environment all the
way up to using databases and web application frameworks to create backend applications.

In the Optional Non-Python Lessons curriculum, I have chosen specific topics to discuss which I have found to be relevant
in my experience as a Software Engineer and will continue to add to them, as appropriate.


# Goals
My goal with this repository is to help introduce programming and more specifically Python to anyone who is interested.
These modules have been created with non-programmers in mind. Before each topic, I will try to specify if an optional
lesson may be beneficial to know before the topic. For example, it may be useful to know the basics of git, bash, and
makefiles before jumping into using Flask. 


# Feedback
This repository should be considered living as I plan to continue adding topics (python or not) and am very open to
feedback received on what can be improved or what topics should be added. For the time being, please submit these
requests via a Pull Request and create a directory for the topic you think I should (in the appropriate section). If you
feel that it does not fit within "Python Lessons" or "Optional Non-Python Lessons", create a new one in the root directory.
Please justify why you think a topic would be relevant and why you added it in the subsection chosen. Please also submit
a Pull Request for any typos or other errors that you see.
