    "## What is REST?\n",
    "REST (REpresentational State Transfer) is a software architectural style that defines web services. We typically use HTTP methods to get/create/update/delete resources. For example, when you think about a user profile you may have on a website. The profile was created when you go through a registration workflow, one of the steps in this workflow is likely making a request to a registration service to `create` a profile. Anytime you make any updates on the website, it is making a request to a profile service to `update` the profile. If you want to get rid of the account, you will need to make a request to the profile service to `delete` the profile. As an end user of the product, you are likely not calling the service manually but the website will be making those requests on your behalf as you click certain buttons on the website\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common HTTP Methods\n",
    "The common HTTP methods are typically covered in the acronym: `CRUD`. This stands for `Create`, `Read`, `Update`, `Delete`. You can think of these as actions being taken on some object. In the example mentioned above, it's a User Profile. When an HTTP method is requested, we get an HTTP Response back. This response contains a `Status Code` and typically some data. Let's take a look the common methods below:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### GET\n",
    "The `GET` method is used, as the name suggested, to get an entity. This refers to the `Read` in `CRUD`. The purpose of `GET` is to return some data back to the user. For example, when you load your User Profile on a website, a `GET` is typically being called to get your data so that the website can visualize it. If the entity exists, `GET` will usually return `200 OK` Status Code. If the entity doesn't exist, a `404 Not Found` Status Code is returned\n",
    "\n",
    "#### HEAD\n",
    "The `HEAD` method is similar to `GET` as it's used to get a response back, but the response is very minimal. There is no data, only a status code is returned. This is usually the same as the `GET`. `200 OK` if the entity exists, `404 Not Found` if not\n",
    "\n",
    "#### POST\n",
    "The `POST` method is used to create an entity. This handles the `Create` in `CRUD`. Per our User Profile example, this is the request that's made during the registration process to create a new profile. There are usually some validations that need to occur when the user is created such as: password requirements, unique username/email, etc. Thus, the creation of the entity can either be successful or fail. The common responses include a `201 Created` if the entity is created or a `4xx` Status Code depending on the error\n",
    "\n",
    "#### PUT\n",
    "A `PUT` method is typically used to update an entity. As you would expect, it handles the `Update` in `CRUD`. Referring back to our User Profile example, if the user wants to change any account details like email/password/phone, a `PUT` request can be used to update the data. There is also a `PATCH` method which is also used to update resources. Typically, `PATCH` is used to update a part of the resource (more applicable to the case mentioned here) while `PUT` is meant to update the entity as a whole. Though, you may find that in some applications, the `PUT` is used in place of both. These typically result in the `200 OK` or `4xx` Error Status Codes\n",
    "\n",
    "#### DELETE\n",
    "Finally, we have `DELETE` which, as the name suggests, is used to delete an entity. Per the User Profle example, this is the method that will be requested when the user tries to delete their profile. Common responses include the `204 No Content` or a `4xx` Error\n",
    "\n",
    "I would recommend doing some research into all of the options as we have only covered a select few. Take a look [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods) for a more thorough list\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common HTTP Response Status Codes\n",
    "Let's take a look at some of the more common status codes below\n",
    "    * 200 OK\n",
    "        * Request was processed\n",
    "    * 201 Created\n",
    "        * Entity was created\n",
    "    * 204 No Content\n",
    "        * Request was processed, no data returned\n",
    "    * 302 Found\n",
    "        * The resource was moved and the request will be redirected\n",
    "    * 400 Bad Request\n",
    "        * There is some error in the request, review the request\n",
    "    * 401 Unauthorized\n",
    "        * The user is not authenticated, retry after authentication\n",
    "    * 403 Forbidden\n",
    "        * The user is authenticated but not allowed to access this resource\n",
    "    * 404 Not Found\n",
    "        * The resource cannot be found\n",
    "    * 405 Method Not Allowed\n",
    "        * This HTTP Method is not allowed (ex: requesting GET instead of POST)\n",
    "    * 500 Internal Server Error\n",
    "        * The service came across an issue and was not able to process the request\n",
    "    * 503 Service Unavailable\n",
    "        * The service came across an issue and is not able to process any requests currently\n",
