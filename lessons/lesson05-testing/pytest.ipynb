    "## Why Test?\n",
    "The main benefit of writing tests is to verify behavior of code so that we are confident in how the code works. The\n",
    "other benefit is that when you contribute to a code source that is constantly being iterated upon or added to, you want\n",
    "to make sure that the changes made do not introduce any issues or change behavior. The existing tests can be re-run after\n",
    "changes in code to make sure everything passes. The goal is to add new test code so that we can maintain a high test\n",
    "coverage and have confidence in our code as we keep developing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pytest\n",
    "`pytest` is a popular testing framework that is used to write tests. pytest allows you to write a variety of tests that\n",
    "can be used to test anything. The framework has many advantages ranging from being easy to use and integrate, run specific\n",
    "sets of tests, skip tests, and even running tests in parallel (run multiple tests at the same time instead of doing it\n",
    "serially, one by one). To use pytest, you will need to download the library using the pip tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install pytest\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pytest Basics\n",
    "For pytest to determine what is a test, we have to wrap test code in methods and the methods need to start with the\n",
    "prefix `test`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def test_something():\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When using Pytest, we use the `assert` keyword to validate specific scenarios. We usually try to assert a boolean value.\n",
    "For example: \n",
    "```python\n",
    "def test_something()\n",
    "    assert 1 == 1           # This will pass and move on\n",
    "    assert 0 == 1           # This will fail and throw an AssertionError\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "With Pytest, we can also validate that specific errors are thrown without breaking our tests\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def test_divide_by_zero_error():\n",
    "    with pytest.raises(ZeroDivisionError):\n",
    "        5 / 0\n",
    "``` \n",
    "\n",
    "With really big test suites, you may sometimes need to skip a test, you can do it via the following:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@pytest.mark.skip(reason=\"no way of currently testing this\")\n",
    "def test_the_unknown():\n",
    "    # some code that doesn't pass the test or we cannot test\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also skip tests based on a condition if you would like:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@pytest.mark.skipif(sys.version_info < (3, 6), reason=\"requires python3.6 or higher\")\n",
    "def test_function():\n",
    "    ...\n",
