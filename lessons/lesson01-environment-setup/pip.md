# pip
pip is the package management system used by Python to download/install software packages written in Python. While many
packages come with the default installation of Python, you will find that you need to install certain packages through
the use of pip. pip should come installed with Python and is very easy to use in the command line. 

```bash
pip install \<package-name\>
```

```bash
pip uninstall \<package-name\>
```
