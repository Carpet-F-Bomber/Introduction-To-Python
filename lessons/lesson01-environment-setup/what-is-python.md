# What is Python?
Python is a high-level programming language that uses an object oriented approach to help create clean, readable, logical
code for small and large applications/projects. One of the main goals for Python is to be an easily readable language.
Heavily relying on the usage of whitespace and not requiring the common curly braces or semicolons allows the code to 
be uncluttered and easily read.

# Python3
There are currently two major versions of Python that are used in the industry: Python2 and Python3. While some still 
use Python2, it should be considered as legacy code while Python3 should be what everyone is using. Python2.7 is the
final major release of Python2.x and the end of life has been [confirmed](https://pythonclock.org/).
