# What is Python?
Python is a high-level programming language that uses an object oriented approach to help create clean, readable, logical
code for small and large applications/projects. One of the main goals for Python is to be an easily readable language.
Heavily relying on the usage of whitespace and not requiring the common curly braces or semicolons allows the code to 
be uncluttered and easily read.
