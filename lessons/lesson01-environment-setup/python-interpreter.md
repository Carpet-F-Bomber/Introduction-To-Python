# Python Interpreter


## Using The Interpreter
To use the interpreter, you can run the following in your terminal:
```bash
Mac-02W5H0SHTD6:Introduction-To-Python r.nair$ python3     # or just python
Python 3.7.0 (v3.7.0:1bf9cc5093, Jun 26 2018, 23:26:24) 
[Clang 6.0 (clang-600.0.57)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> 
```

Once the interpreter launches, you can see that it prints out a bunch of information showing
details such as Python version `Python 3.7.0` and other details. Once you are in the interpreter,
you can start running Python commands and it will print out a response after (if there is one)

```bash
>>> x = 5       # run a command to set 'x' equal to the value 5 
>>> x           # if we look at what 'x' is, we are returned the value
5               # we are told that x has a value of 5
```

To exit the interpreter, you can type one of the following and hit "Enter":

#### exit()
```bash
>>> 
>>> exit()
Mac-02W5H0SHTD6:Introduction-To-Python r.nair$ 
```

#### control + d
```bash
>>> ^D
Mac-02W5H0SHTD6:Introduction-To-Python r.nair$ 
```
