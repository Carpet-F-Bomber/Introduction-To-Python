# Congratulations
You made it through all of the Python modules! I hope this has been an educational experience for you.

Now that you have wrangled the basics of Python development, I hope that you feel comfortable enough to embark on your
own journey in software development and create something on your own!


# Next Steps
As someone who has gone through this material, I would love to get feedback on anything that can be improved for this 
documentation. Anything from grammatical errors to new topics, please submit a `Pull Request` for any suggested changes
and I will tackle that. 

For your own growth, I highly recommend creating personal programming projects and putting them up on GitHub. Whether
it is for a portfolio that you can show employers or because you want to keep learning, creating and working on projects
is an excellent way you can keep improving your skills. If you can't seem to come up with an idea, there are plenty of 
open projects on GitHub that you can contribute to yourself. Here is a list of [repositories](https://github.com/MunGell/awesome-for-beginners)
you can contribute to today! 


# Thank You

experience. I wish you the best of luck!
