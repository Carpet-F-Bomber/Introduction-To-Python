# Output
As we've seen in the past with our examples, as well as being able to take in text and data, we can also print it back
out. Similar to input, we can print out directly to the console or wherever the code is running or we can write to a
file. There are reasons and benefits to both and it will be up to you to determine what fits your needs better

## Console
As we've seen many time, we can print things to the console via the print command

```python
print('hello')                              # basic print

x = 5
print('This is a number: {}'.format(x))     # print with formatting


print(f'the number {x} is five')            # print using f-string
```
