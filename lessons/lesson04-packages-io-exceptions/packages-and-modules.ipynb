    "# Modules and Packages\n",
    "Within python, we can use existing Python code to our benefit. You never want to re-invent the wheel. Why waste time\n",
    "building a tool when there could already be an existing solution that may do what you want AND more? As mentioned previously\n",
    "in the pip section, we are able to download existing libraries of code. We will investigate certain libraries that will\n",
    "be helpful. Beyond using other people's code, we sometimes create multiple files within a directory for python code to\n",
    "differentiate the purpose of files. For example, you may have a `hello.py` file which handles some functions to say hello.\n",
    "Similarly, you may have another file, `get_info.py`, which does other things like asking for the user to input a name and pass that\n",
    "name to other functions! In this section, let's take a closer look on how we can use libraries that others have written \n",
    "and what we have created ourselves.\n",

    "## Modules\n",
    "A module is a single python file that can be imported. For example, when we want to use `get_info.py` methods within our\n",
    "`hello.py` file, you want to import that module. The import section below will show how we can do that!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Packages\n",
    "A package is a directory of modules. A package gives us the opportunity to keep code organized. Packages come in handy \n",
    "so we can keep modules in one area. For example, we may have a package called `user` which has the modules `get`,\n",
    "`create`, `delete`. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### \\_\\_init__.py\n",
    "To create a Python package, you must have a file within the directory (and all subdirectories of said package) called\n",
    "`__init__.py`. This file just has to exist, we don't need to put any information within it, nice and easy!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Imports\n",
    "First and foremost, after a specific file is written, you will need to start the file you want to use that behavior in\n",
    "with some imports. The `import` keyword is used to pull in modules and packages. If we have the file in the same directory,\n",
    "you can import it like the following:\n",
