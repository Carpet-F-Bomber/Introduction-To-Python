# Types
As seen in the previous topic, there are types in Python. We initially looked at an `int` and
a `string`. We will discuss those and a couple others below.


## Boolean
A boolean is essentially a binary value (meaning it has 2 potential values). Typically, booleans
are used to represent `True` or `False`. Booleans are usually used in evaluating some sort of
logic, such as checking if variables are equal to each other.

```python
x = True            # x represents a Boolean (True)

x is True           # True, because x = True

x is False          # False, because x = True
```

Booleans can also be represented with numbers. 0 represents `False` while 1 (or any other number)
represents `True`.


## String
As seen before, a string represents 1 or more text characters that are wrapped with quotes. These
quotes can be single `'` or double `"`, but which ever is used to start the string, must also
end the string.

```python
x = 'this is a string'  # Valid

y = "this is a string"  # Valid

x == y                  # True (Even though they use diff quotations to start/end, they are equal)
```



## Int



## Float
