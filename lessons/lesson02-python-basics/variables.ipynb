    "A variable is a container for storing data values. We can set a variable equal to some text, a number, and several\n",
    "other things. In programming, variables are handy tools which we use all the time. Let's take a look at how to use\n",

    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 5\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example, we set the variable (named x) equal to the number 5. After this line, the variable x will always have\n",
    "the value 5, until it is either changed or deleted.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 5           # x = 5\n",

    "x = \"hello\"     # x is now a \"string\" which represents some text\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing we can do with variables is to check if they are equal in value to other things. We do this with `==` or the\n",

    "x = 5           # x = 5\n",
    "\n",
    "x == 5          # True\n",
    "\n",
    "x is 5          # True\n",
    "\n",
    "x == 2          # False\n",

    "x is not \"5\"    # True\n",
